# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Task

I created a calendar application that allows users to input events for each hour of the day.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Features

```md
The current day/time is displayed at the top of the calendar (Moment.js)
Color coded timeblocks for standard business hours that indicate whether it's in the past present or future
Users can click into a timeblock and enter an event
Users can I click the save button for that timeblock and save the event in local storage
When users refresh the page the saved events persist
```
